- The complete Verilog code and the project MPF file "Processor" are found 
inside the folder "Verilog".
- This code includes an instruction memory, a register file, and a data memory. 
- We have initialized 14 values of the instruction memory in the InstrMemory module 
to test all possible instruction types performable by this processor. 
- Details of the initialized instructions and their expected results are found in
 the .txt file "Instruction Information.txt"
- To run the simulation, run the clock and force reset to 1 for one clock cycle.
- A screenshot of a correct simulation of all 14 instructions is uploaded as
 "Simulation Example.JPG".
- The schematic of the used ALU and the microprocessor and the truth tables of
 the ALU, Main Decoder, and ALU Decoder are found in the file PDF file "Report."

Enjoy :)
